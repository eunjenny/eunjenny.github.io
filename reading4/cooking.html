	<div class="text"> I want to metaphor website to a cooking.Cooking can be made by choosing the ingredients and composition of recipes you want while imagining as if you were a chef, and there is a process of organizing, checking the taste, and correcting the ingredients and ingredients you want. Also, I imagine what I want to make, experience them, and try to make them similar to the good foods I've tasted before, but eventually, my cooking is completed with my own cooking. I can make my own things to my liking, and I thought that I was creating something new and that the way I was making it was like an artist making an individual website, so I came up with a metaphor. I think the website is cooking and the artist who makes it is the chef. </div>
