Q1: Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do You agree with her? Please explain your answer.
<br>
<br>
According to the reading, Laurel Schwulst thinks especially pressing when an age of information overload and an increasingly commercialized web, artists of all types are the people to help. Artists can think expansively about what a website can be. Each artist should create their own space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition. I agree with her That we need individuals today rather than companies that will lead the future of the web. By creating their own website, artists can design their world, create their own works, and create their own. The social media we're using today feels very convenient and attractive, but we don't focus on our users, our happiness or our needs. They're focusing more on making advertising a priority than on users and generating their profits. So we can't say we're their subjects. From this perspective, it is very necessary for artists to create their own websites, exist as subjects and objects, and build their own identities and works, and I think it is very helpful for individuals to lead their own websites and find their own identity. It is very important to create your own space, and I think it is necessary for each artist to expand and develop their strength and power.<br>
<br>
Q2: In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.

I want to metaphor website to cooking. Cooking can be made by choosing the ingredients and composition of recipes you want while imagining as if you were a chef, and there is a process of organizing, checking the taste, and correcting the ingredients and ingredients you want. Also, I imagine what I want to make, experience them, and try to make them similar to the good foods I've tasted before, but eventually, my cooking is completed with my own cooking. I can make my own things to my liking, and I thought that I was creating something new and that the way I was making it was like an artist making an individual website, so I came up with a metaphor. I think the website is cooking and the artist who makes it is the chef.
