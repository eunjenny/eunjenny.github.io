<a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools" target="_blank"> The Poetry of Tools by Mindy Seu</a>
</p>
<p>Q1: In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?
<br>
<br>
According to the article, "Let’s defamiliarize our tools and use them as a vehicle for contemplation." she says that she makes our tools defamiliarize and uses them as a means of meditation. The tools that we talk about here are the things that we do on a daily interface that we point at, swipe at, browse through, type in, and click on. They say that identifying the constraints of these tools can help us recognize their poetic potential. Technology comes to us as the use of tools. Continuous development and various kinds of technologies We think that the idea of these tools and the way in which we use technology, the elimination and thinking of functions can help us recognize our poetic potential. Literary works express different emotions and thoughts for each person who sees them. Like this, I think poetry is constantly capable of various kinds of interpretations and endings and means infinite possibilities. I think what she's trying to say in her writing is that she thinks that these tools help us to bring in new perspectives and potentials by feeling unfamiliar, so she means to defamiliarize our tools and use them as a vehicle for contemplation.<br>
<br>
Q2:Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.
<br>

I choose the Removing Function from form because working directly in interface format rather than reinterpreting the Removing Function from form data. To separate the aesthetics of the tool from the proposed purpose, the following fragment reimagines the external elements of the tool and browser. I thought that this example of being able to create new things in an empty canvas environment and apply and put things that you want into what you want, not what you're using the tool for, but what you want. I thought that's how the early examples of illustrations were. Basically, it's different from the use of the tool that you use, but it's structured in a way that doesn't express the elements of the tool. It's removing the function from the form. That's how this <a href="https://mondrianandme.com/" target="_blank">website</a> I found works. On the canvas with nothing on the first screen, form a line in a cliché position and continue to form a line to create the desired rectangle, and click on the surface to fill in the colour. I chose it as an example because I thought it was the best way to remove functions from the form. I think that the process of filling in the empty interface with nothing is forming without the proposed purpose, and that works to match the functional removal of the classification form of tool poetry that she talked about and what I thought about Removing function from form.
