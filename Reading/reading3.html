</p>
<p>
  Q1: What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?
<br>
<br>
 Lialina's opinion of the"user"  I felt that they wanted to get rid of the word "user" without being noticed. The article also says that they want to get rid of the word user and call them people. I think that if we recognize the word user and divide them into one category, we narrow down the factors to be considered about how to use it to the user, and not just the concept of the term itself, but also to other paradigms, and to be considered as human in the design and verification process. In addition, Lialina seems to have an antipathy to the word user itself. She is also explaining in more detail, exploring how the use of the term is organized and settled. It seems to me that we need to focus more on technology and experience, not just on computers and digital, but on whether users can communicate with them and develop and communicate and implement what they want.<br>
<br>
Q2:What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
<br>
<br>
She calls the user Turing complete and says efforts are made to educate the user about herself. The ideal quality of a user is the concept of a "The General Purpose User" I think the concept of the general-purpose user is not historical thinking or temporary ideals, but the ideal user is to ultimately engage between humans and computers by the symbiosis of what we can do and what computers can do. Through true symbiosis, it is to live with computers with the mindset of a general-purpose user. It applies universal technology to users based on their needs and interests, and users have the skills to achieve their desired goals through applications or devices. In other words, it interacts with computer interface design and uses it. I think the ideal quality of a user is that a computer does not only a computer's job, but a user does not only a given job but also a universal symbiosis and uses it through interaction.

Q3: From your own experiences interacting on the webâ€”what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?

<br>
<br>
  
According to the article, she said"situation when the work flow of an application has gaps that can be filled by users, where smoothness and seamlessness are broken and some of the final links in the chain are left for the users to complete.".I think it means a space where users can fill in, not a complete form, but a space where users' experiences and interactions exist. Among the apps I've used or experienced, social media apps fill this gap and talk and write in the way that each person wants. For example, you can selectively communicate with the person you want on Instagram and not disclose your information to the person when you don't want to. Also, you can freely leave your photos and writings and talk to others. However, this is different for every user and they experience and interact in the way they want. I think the framework that the developers have created, and some of the unfinished parts, is the way to fill in the final link with the experience and interaction of the individual user.
