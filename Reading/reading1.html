  Q1: What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?
<br>
<br>
The most challenging part of the critique is the language because my first language is Korean, but I have to use English when I critique my work or others' work. Then, I need to take more time because of the translation processing in my brain from Korean to English. I think it's already been a long time, so I'm embarrassed, and I think it's not easy to give a proper answer or criticize someone else's work. So, I lose time or something. Moreover, this problem will make it hard to express my feeling or emotion. Second, I don't want to hurt people's feelings. I know that it is not about humanity or person, but I don't think it's easy to say critical comments or pointsâ€”the reason why I don't think I've mastered how to express a kind and critical opinion. Thus, I'm not convinced that my criticisms can necessarily lead their work to a good side, especially in an environment where I'm not sure if my feelings and thoughts match what they wanted to create. That's why I'm more careful and have a hard time when I'm criticizing. I feel like if someone else criticizes it when they are satisfied with their work, I feel like I'm going to discourage them or lose their courage.
<br>
<br>
Q2: How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?
<br>
<br>
When I get critique, if I disagree with that, I ask specific questions and try to understand why they think that. I'm trying to get an explanation of why they felt that, more specifically. After that, if it makes sense, I tend to think about my work again and think about what to improve. But sometimes, I just forget about the criticism. In particular, I don't think much about comments or opinions that I disagree with when I'm very satisfied. However, I think this needs to be improved. Because criticism doesn't have the correct answer, it's to develop further and help the work. In addition, I think disagreeing opinions are a necessary factor for everyone. This is because everyone thinks the same thing and doesn't feel the same way. Therefore, it is important to gather many opinions and thoughts from various people and accept opinions even if they are not happy to improve my work based on them.

Q3: Why do you think it's important to give and receive critiques?
<br>
<br>
  
Everyone has a different way of accepting critiques, but one of the important things is that we can learn from critiques how to collaborate with people and converse with people. In addition, we can find new things that we don't even think about in each other's work. It's an opportunity to think about the direction of improvement while exchanging those opinions. This is because many elements develop through the process of accepting each other's views and exchanging ideas, focusing on the purpose and value of criticism being improved. In addition, in the process of understanding and communicating the point of criticism, we learn about collaboration and develop communication skills, which can bring positive results to work and each other. Furthermore, I think it can bring about a change in my perspective. It will come as a huge developmental factor for me to broaden my perspective by thinking on a new level by accepting opinions.
