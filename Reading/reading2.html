  Q1: Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.
<br>
<br>
 I think both ideological camps are very creative and remarkable designs, but for me, I think the flat design is better than skeuo. The reason why the flat design's key point is minimalism and simplicity, so It would be better for the user. The users can focus on technology and content. For example, it is designed to allow users to recognize functions simply by colour alone, by emphasizing visual elements with a two-dimensional grid and colour contrast, excluding shadow effects or three-dimensional reflections. I thought it allowed me to focus more on functions and content, so I thought the flat design was a little better. I think its strength is that it is an interface that users intuitively recognize and use. Also, I think it will be designed in a more difficult way than skeuomorphism to build an efficient interface in a simple way without adding a lot of graphics when it is made. Unlike a realistic imitation of the object, it is a more comfortable interface to see and build with only the necessary functions in that it can be felt concisely by intuition.

Q2: What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
<br>
<br>
According to the reading, I think web and interactive design are as closely related to filmmaking as graphic design. It's because I think it's one of the main entrances in making a Zoopraxiscope screen. This is because I work on the screen and manage time, movement, and change. Screen design is described as managing the change, which I think is in line with almost all the media. I think the process of filming a movie or drama, and connecting and controlling each part and capturing it on one screen is very similar I think it's because the process of creating is an important part. In addition, in the process of making animation, we think that trying various things, such as the passage and sequence of time and the opposite arrangement, exploring the movement of the object, and dealing with the transition of the scene can be linked to the web and interaction design. Also, I think that 4d and 3d movies affect digital design similarly in the process of web and interaction design that is developed in a responsive way because the movie audience eventually predicts and makes their reactions.

Q3:Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.

<br>
<br>
  
I agree that the screen wants flux. I think screens should be convenient, well-organized, and intuitive to see what users want by building the desired screen technology and interacting with them constantly. I think there's a flux in how we can use the efficiency and power of the interface to increase its usefulness. This is because it makes it easier for users to create, change, and create, and it makes the content that we see feel like the screen and I am interacting with each other by organizing it with an animation sensor. In addition, I think the ability of flux can lead to a huge amount of change in our digital world because by changing it to flux, users can feel that the interface is changing by customizing it to me. It's a trivial thing, but I saw an example of changing the colour of the website at night to provide an experience on time, and I thought I would agree. The reason is, that when I first went through this change, I was surprised that it made my eyes more relaxed and aware of the flow of time, so I thought I agreed that the screen want flux.
