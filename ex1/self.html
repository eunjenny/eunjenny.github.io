<p> Here is my website I used to create my self-portrait
	<br>
	<a href="https://deepdreamgenerator.com/" target="_blank"> deepdreamgenerator</a>
	<br>
	This website is that converts photos into pictures of the style I want. I can choose the picture I want, upload it, and choose a style to convert it.

	My name is Jenny and I’m an international student from South Korea. I’m in the Digital futures program 3rd year. One of my favourite things is taking a  picture, and building something new. The reason why I choose this website, it makes my photo makes different. It looks like another photo, and I liked the effect of making it look like a picture. Thus, I also like drawing, so I like the way they are expressed like a drawing. In the original photo, I'm holding the edge of the cherry blossom, and I like how it's expressed as a new and mysterious space. It was very good to be able to express what I want by choosing the theme and feel of the painting I want.
